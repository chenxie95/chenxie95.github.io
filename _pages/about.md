I have been very fortunate to study and live in many great cities over the past decades. I received my Ph.D degree from the Engineering Department of Cambridge University in 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Gales](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/). Before entering Cambridge, I received my bachelor and master degrees from Xiamen University and Tsinghua University in 2009 and 2012 respectively. I also was a Research Associate at Cambridge from 2016 to 2018 after graduation. Then I spent three wonderful years in the speech and language research group of Microsoft in Seattle as a senior and principal researcher from 2018 to 2021. I joined the [Computer Science and Engineering department of SJTU](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) as an associate
professor since Oct. 2021. I am also a member of the [SJTU X-LANCE lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/).  

My current research interests mainly lie in deep learning, especially in its application on speech and multi-modality processing, including speech recognition, speech-oriented self-supervised learning, and audio-driven talking head.
