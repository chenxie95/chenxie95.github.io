I have been very fortunate to study and live in many great cities over the past decades. I received my PhD degree from Engineering Department of Cambridge University in 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Gales](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/). Before entering Cambridge, I received my bachelor and master degrees from Xiamen University and Tsinghua University respectively. I was a Research Associate in Cambridge from 2016 to 2018 after my graduation. Then I joined the speech and language research group at Microsoft  in Seattle as a senior and principal researcher from 2018 to 2021. I joined computer science and engineering department as an associate
professor in 2021.10. I am also a member the [SJTU X-LANCE lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en).  

My current research interests mainly lie in deep learning, especially on its application on speech and multi-modality processing, including speech recogition, speech oriented self-supervised learning and audio-driven talking head.
